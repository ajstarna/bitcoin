Work-in-progress implementation of the Bitcoin protocol. 
I am primarily using https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook and https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page as my sources. 
This project is for me to understand the inner workings of the Bitcoin protocol and to continuing developing my Rust skills.
